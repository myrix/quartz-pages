**Gradiented UI bars**

UI bars (health, energy, wisdom) would look better and make game more appealing if they would have slight gradient, just enough to notice.

Don't need anything fancy, a simple implementation with linear interpolation between colors at certain points of the bar would suffice.

Gradient UI bars look better than flat color in general, and next to picture-like ability icons which have gradients themselves the current UI bar color flatness is even more apparent:

Just to illustrate how gradient can look more appealing, see e.g. YouTube player bar

and the game logo, logo with gradient looks obviously better than the one without:

Naturally could also add gradient to bars of Character F4 panel, and perhaps slightly modify bar color away from current not so appealing brown-orange:

Could also add gradient to to mastery/skill/magic bars xp bars, now that they would also be near new picture-like ability icons:
