hunger
travel weariness — rate, slower / no,
increase time it takes to get hungry
increase distance it takes to get the same amount of weariness


for ability cost reduction etc.
internally points (with understanding that from 0 to 50 we have 1 point = 1%)
externally in UI show the player only percents


give player the simplest picture sufficient for understanding




disconnect with other areas, e.g. loot from pit-killed enemies:

If a loot bag would fall onto an invalid tile (e.g., a pit) upon an enemy's death, it will now move to the nearest valid tile, ensuring your rewards are always within reach.


"resilience"
"efficiency"
but then need to inform the player how it relates to actual use
"travel efficiency" --- +1% to distance travelled for the same travel weariness


endurance meters — visually different, silver or off-yellow or yellow-silver or yellow-golden

responsive controls

current: x%, +y.yy% per additional source %

also in movement?
+y.yy move speed per additional source move speed

principle of minimal momentary confusion

travel weariness / agency / wandering armies

can't rest with pursuing armies
armies pursue, can lose interest at some distance, don't let up
unless have previous target
if have previous target, can split or let go


make escape work
player moves to neighbour tile, enemy follows, engages
player again escapes — enemy again follows
and that continues until player either decides to fight, maybe when the army is busy with another mobs in the tile, or leads to another army or location


more gradual, soften the blow


"let me get a word in edgewise! fffss!"


minus rep for leading an army to a faction's town
minus rep for escaping battle to let the guards handle it, -x2 rep if lead army there

make rep hits large enough to matter
travel weariness angle, can't lead around enemy army indefinitely
being followed adds to the travel weariness rate?

disconnect from realism in some sense
disconnect from combat and all these mobility options

harder to escape from hunting armies depending on times they caught you

QoL

steam discussion, and I also had this problem, died cause forgot about hunger

noticeable overworld dangerous condition banner, which is half-transparent and can be disabled (and enable back in options)

two checkboxes:
-show dangerous condition banner (if disabled, can be enabled back in options)
-disallow overworld moving / waiting if dangerous condition

for bleed/poison/starving

this would also allow to add hunger back to overworld waiting / travel, if at reduced rate
