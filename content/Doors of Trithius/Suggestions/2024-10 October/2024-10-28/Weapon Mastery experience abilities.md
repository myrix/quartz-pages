> XP bonus passives were indeed filler abilities since they are quite simple to code. There's something to be said for having small 1 point passives which promote interesting tradeoffs. The problem is the XP bonuses causes you to feel like you are missing out unless you get them - min/maxers feel they need to get them early to play "optimally" for this reason they are not ideal. Better to make room with something more interesting.

If the problem is this "missing out" incentive considered harmful, I would suggest mitigating it instead of removing abilties. Mitigating it by requiring 5 mastery level for experience ability 1, requiring 10 mastery level for experience ability 2 and so on, 25 mastery level for experience ability 5.

This way player a) is not forced to either get the ability as soon as possible or feel missing out; b) can discover how other abilities can actually be more beneficial for progression than straight up +%xp; and c) still can have these +%xp bonuses.

Personally, I like having small 1 fp passives, and I like experience bonuses, so I wouldn't want to see them go.

Could add the same x5 mastery level requirements to other 1 fp passives, -energy cost & +effect chance in generalist weapon masteries and +accuracy and +attack speed in specialist weapon masteries.

**Other possible modification**

Turn them into a scaling passive of +1% xp per mastery level, like +1% damage per mastery level in specialist weapon masteries.
