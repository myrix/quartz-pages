> throwing weapons are in the roadmap, so at least as a ranged ammo option we should eventually have them
> 
> I'm hoping for a decent variety like with other weapon types, imagine throwing knives, throwing axes, throwing stars, throwing short spears / darts; throwing hammers?
> there was a discussion about what throwing weapons in general we could have, there were some more unusual suggestions like chakram iirc
> 
> also imagine less usual throwing weapons which are for less damage and more for effects, like bolos and nets for slowing/immobilizing enemies
> 
> we should also be able to enchant them, probably a special case of en mass enchanting for them, to enchant a number at once?
> we could also have some throwing weapons specific enchantments, maybe of an automatic return?

> image if you're good enough with athletics and throwing weapons you're all ninja-like kiting around a melee boss and just killing it with throwing knives which automatically return to you, and you don't even take damage
