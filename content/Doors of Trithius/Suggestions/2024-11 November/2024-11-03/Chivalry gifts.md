**Chivalry gifts balance**

Continuing with the theme of balancing permanent bonuses, could also balance Chivalry's permanent +max hp gifts in the same way, make them available only up to the current character level.

Why balance at all? At least some players feel it's needed, e.g. *Bambinator the deer* in somewhat recent [Steam discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1519490/discussions/0/4700160645243044861/):

> Then talk to me about balance it is a PVE game and this mechanic exists for the knight statue (oath of the fallen) logically you can have an unlimited number of life points with the favors of the statue, you just have to kill a significant number of non-human monsters (I am at 189 hp).

Bonus point, this would neuter currently present maybe not so good incentive to min-max Chilvalry gifts by only going for +max hp and never for +wisdom, never mind +gold. With the cap +wisdom gift would actually be obviously useful even if the player intends to use the gifts in an optimal way.

**Secret cooking/alchemy way**

With the same cap, permanent +max hp / +max energy only up to char level (probably better separate per origin, though if for some reason need harder restrictions could go for the cap on total from all sources), could safely introduce some secret cooking/alchemy recipes for permanent +max hp / +max energy, perhaps with new exotic ingredients.

Could make some of the required ingredients rare or very rare, e.g. a low percentage enemy drop not sold anywhere.
