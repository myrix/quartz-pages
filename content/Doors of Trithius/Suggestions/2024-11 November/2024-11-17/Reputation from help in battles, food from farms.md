Suggestions from a [Steam discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1519490/discussions/0/4630357487253559461/#c6400272691576762617):

> Agree regarding waiting in the overworld, don't think it should give wisdom and travelling xp just for waiting, though amount it gives is so small I would call it inconsequential.
> 
> Would also enable hunger in the overworld, even if maybe at a reduced rate, so that there is a cost to overworld waiting.
> 
> Could get reputation from raids only in proportion to your contribution, e.g. min 1 rep if you used ability on a enemy or beneficial ability on a defender at least once, and then other rep in proportion to how much enemy health damage you actually dealt.
> 
> Would like penalties to reputation for just taking other people's stuff, including food at farms. Perhaps would be better if farmers would have conditions or quests (defeat surrounding dungeons to stop raids?) so that you can take food without reputation loss only if you fulfilled the condition.
