actually simpler way to balance Gem Refraction and remove possibly undesirable incentive for farming required items:
cap bonus at character level, so it's `min(# of required items in inventory, character level)`

justification: as it happens can use the technique to help yourself only to the extent you are strong on your own

has desirable side-effect, makes character level even more meaningful and important
