[Steam discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1519490/discussions/0/3825284144462183326/), some players found themselves stuck in the main quest when they used their ascension fragment for something other than the main quest.

Perhaps would be better to add a main quest update in that case? So that if you ever use up all your fragments (that counting ones in any storage) before giving using one for the main quest, it would add the main quest update, something like:

"I should find another fragment if I would want to continue with this investigation. The first I found was in the temple, perhaps other temples would have more?"

Can differentiate if already experienced finding additional fragments in temples, then it can be something like:

"If I would want to continue this investigation, I would need another fragment from another temple."
