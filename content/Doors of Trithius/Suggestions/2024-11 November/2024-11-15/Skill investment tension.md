# Rationale

failure of agency

player can recognize shifting priorities

can't get agency out of the game if the game doesn't have a way for it in the first place

multiple questions on how to train Athletics?

how to train Quartermastery?

# Text

Stumbled upon this and was somewhat surprised by assessment on weapons masteries, skill investment and combat skills cause of apparent contradiction.

Maybe some is due to how in the past investment was absolutely required for skill cap raising — since recent update skills caps also scale off character level, so investment is always, or almost always, is free to be used just for raising skills you want and not for stopping other skills from capping — but the core issue still remains the same.

> \- I feel like having weapon skills as masteries that cannot be raised by skill points is very smart! Non-combat skills shouldn't compete with combat skills in my opinion. Either by allowing non-combat characters to be as viable as the combat ones (which this game doesn't seem to be about), or simply disallowing it by design. Issue is with dreadheart, chivalry, and athletics, which do compete with non-combat skills. The game makes clear that it doesn't fuss around, so if I get a choice between between being able to eat forest berries, and being able to eat the last boss's face to restore my HP mid-combat, I'll pick the latter. I wouldn't mind if these were masteries.

> As I see it, skills that can be in 95% of time raised only via combat such as dreadheart or acrobatics, they shouldn't be able to be raised via skill points, because that makes it too appealing. I think they should be a non-weapon mastery.

**1. Contradiction**

The contradiction is in saying that not allowing weapon masteries to be raised with skill points is good, because the combat is a big chuck of the game and we would like more combat power and would like to be able to raise weapon masteries faster so thanks to the game for not allowing us to do that. I can't help but see this as an inconsistency.

Yeah, being allowed to invest in weapon masteries would mean that less skill points would go into general skills, but I very much would like that! And the game curbs my agency by not allowing me to, that's not a good thing.

And then in different circumstances I might want to instead invest in general skills, cause weapons masteries I use are at a point of diminishing returns and I would get more from investing in some general skills, or maybe I now want a particular ability, or for roleplay reasons, or I decided to try another play style for a change, or for any other of multitude of possible reason. And that, where I would like to invest, would change between playthroughs and during the same playthrough too.

I want to be able to mix and match and be given more control over my progression. Maybe I want a super-optimized playthrough, to try to win with as low character level as possible, some investment in my main weapon mastery would help. Maybe I would like instead to be a generalist and for a personal achievement or just cause I like such playstyle reach certain levels in everything, then I would want to invest in things that are lagging behind.

The same with combat general skills, Dreadheart, Chivalry, Warrapt and Athletics. It's appealing to invest into them cause that allows to win in combat harder and faster, and that's a good thing that we can! Again can't help but find it inconsistent for myself to say it's appealing, I want that, better that the game would prevent me from doing.

I'm against making combat skills uninvestable. If I want to increase my combat prowess, in the moment, for a stretch of a playthough of for all of the playthrough, I want to be able to invest in them. And if, or when, I wouldn't want investing into them no more, I would stop that and would start investing in other things.

It's an open world, you decide your build and progression, there's no standard imposed from above for what your skill distribution should look like and even what skills you'd need to unlock and what skills you don't. Want to be more of a combat machine, ok, invest in combat skills and weapon masteries, that's alright if some general skill would lag behind. Want to be more of a generalist for personal preferences, or cause you're just cozily coasting in the open world, alright, invest however you'd like, maybe in the skills that are relatively behind, maybe in what's you current fancy.

**2. Value in informing the player**

I recognize that there may be a value in nudging player in particular direction, e.g. investing in general skills and not combat masteries, when the player isn't yet that familiar with what general skills could do and would benefit from getting experience of leveling and using general skills to truly feel their usefulness.

But to do that by not giving the player agency to invest however they like, including in combat masteries, is very unequal, very unappealing exchange, player will get acquainted with the skills eventually, but the agency is lost forever.

Instead, if the aim is to acquaint, could add some diegetic means, e.g. quest chains which would require particular skills to start and advancement in such skills to continue. Maybe some faction quest chains, or something like guild quest chains? Perhaps medicine with some sort of healers association or guild, reading for some college (bards' college?), alchemy for alchemist group in a quest to recover ancient recipe? For enchanting, some quest chain with druids, and/or could tie to another character background, enchanting.

**3. Possible (partial?) reason for tension**

Sineso mentioned (on discord) the perceived tension between weapon masteries and general skills; for me the only thing which feels off is that weapon masteries are treated differently than the skills, that they are immediately unlocked without the need to invest a skill point after discovering them, and that we can't invest skill points in them.

But perhaps there's partial discrepancy in how the skills are leveled as pertains to their relation to combat, which is a largest part of the game. In short, for some skills there's a certain disconnect between a) how much they are useful for and used in combat, and b) how much xp they get and how quickly they level from combat. And this to some extent forces on the players a sort of perverse incentive to make up for this disconnect by preferentially investing in such skills, and this might be possibly at least partial reason for the aforementioned tension.

To give the gist of it, Athletics, Warrapt, Dreadhart and Chilvalry, in order of decreasing severity, have a problem if being mainly useful for and used in combat, but receiving relatively less xp than weapon masteries, due to weapon masteries having not only active skills giving xp on each activation but also receiving xp for any damage dealt. These 4 combat skills however do not have this xp income stream, and their usefulness for a large part comes from their passives which do not give xp even though they're useful and take up skill levels.

This is illustrated by players asking frequently enough how to level Athletics and Warrapt, e.g. on discord for Athletics [CazicThule](https://discord.com/channels/724418094495301632/933806465641218140/1303132304633368666), [Echo](https://discord.com/channels/724418094495301632/933806465641218140/1302795912703119361), [Zen](https://discord.com/channels/724418094495301632/724418094495301636/1295829477078728806), for Warrapt [mim](https://discord.com/channels/724418094495301632/933806465641218140/1297829797778423839), [Kacy Roush](https://discord.com/channels/724418094495301632/724418094495301636/1297590148023713873).

While it may seem that removing ability to invest in these skills would solve the problem by getting the players rid of this feeling of having to make up for this discrepancy, it won't actually solve the underlying problem of comparatively slower leveling and have very severe undesirable effect of taking agency away from players.

Proper way to solve this would be to give some skill xp when a passive is being useful in combat, bringing these four skills a little bit more up to par to weapon masteries from a standpoint of leveling due to combat.

**4. More detailed consideration**

How do skills relate to combat? Well, some maybe don't, though it's more actually just one. The game has three base areas/systems the player engages/struggles with:

1. Character stuff — the most basic one, actually just hunger and avoiding it, cause everything else with character you struggle with, like health/energy restoration, directly relates to combat.
    
    Has I would say no associated skills, there's a direct hunger managing effect in Survival, but it's of limited effect, could fully do without it, and don't actually need Cooking to manage hunger, Cooking can be helpful but it's more about cooking better food for more hp & energy & beneficial buffs in combat.
    
2. Environment stuff — second largest, though still dwarfed by combat, how do you traverse overworld effectively to achieve your goals and how do you avoid damage by the environment.
    
    Has Travel, and I would say is the only skill that isn't somehow related to combat, but there is absolutely no problems with it, it levels on its own without any investment just from travelling and discovering the overworld.
    
3. And the combat, the largest area/system, and all skills except Travel are directly or indirectly useful for and used by it.

Let's look at all these skills as they level in relation to combat from two opposite ends.

First are weapon masteries, with the most direct relationship, you damage enemies with weapons, you level your masteries. Level only from combat and have absolutely no problems with leveling, they level fine without investment (though would be good to be able to invest to give players the agency for faster leveling them if players would like to).

**4.1. Support skills**

On the opposite end are support skills that aren't used directly in combat, but which get full share of xp to the extent they are combat-useful, and there's also no problems with their leveling.

Take e.g. Alchemy, you use it at least for basic health and energy potions, and you can say that, to the extent it's actively used in combat, combat indirectly contributes full xp for its use as each potion consumed in combat gave you some Alchemy xp when you crafted it. That alone is enough to level Alchemy on it's own, and that's not counting potions you craft to sell to get money to buy any other useful things, like additional ingredients. So no problem with leveling and no need for investment.

Or you don't actually use Alchemy that much cause you don't need it, maybe that's not to your taste or you just couldn't be bothered, and that's also fine, while it won't level or level very slowly, you are not actually concerned with it cause you don't need it, again no need for investment, and while it doesn't get xp from combat even indirectly it isn't used in combat at all so there's no discrepancy.

The same with Cooking, you might actually have no need for it. Or you might use it extensively to prepare food for healing and buffs in combat and to sell to buy more of things you need, like prepare and sell basic foods to get more ingredients for more complex foods. In both cases there's no need for investment, it either levels on its own or you don't need it, and if it is used for combat each food consumed gave you some Cooking xp when it was prepared.

Medicine is more engaged with combat, like Cooking and Alchemy you get its xp from crafting in the same way to them, but you also get its xp from curing wounds, some of which you get in combat. And again, when you need it and use it it levels on its own, no need for investment.

Botany relates to combat even more indirectly, but there's still a more or less relative equality between how it's useful for combat and how much xp it receives from that usefullness, even indirectly. You gather ingredients for your medicines and potions you use in combat, and for each potion/medicine you consume in combat you had some Botany xp when you gathered their ingredients. Or even more indirectly, but still to the same extent, you gather ingredients to sell them or things crafted from them to get more other combat-helpful things, and you had Botany xp when gathering these ingredients. Levels on its own, no need to invest.

Reading is not thought as a combat-use skill due to even more indirect nature of its passive buffs, so the relation still holds to a large extent, it gets xp from combat (none directly enough to be perceivable) near enough to the extent it's useful or perceived to be useful for combat (little). And it is also cab be leveled on its own with no investment, start from easy and skill books and slowly working your way up the ladder. 

For Enchanting I would argue the relation (get xp from combat proportionally to how it's useful for combat) still holds, and not because you got Enchanted xp for each enchanted item you use in combat. It's more to do with the perception of Enchanted not as a buff skill, but as a 2nd order buff creation skill, for which very hard work gets you very good rewards is true. You spend effort and time on it, and in the end you get a very powerful tool-creating tool. And just as reading it can be leveled on its own without investment, though less so.

Survival is more of the same, parts directly used in combat, like Second Wind, give plenty xp, parts indirectly useful in combat, like arrow crafting, also give xp, and the skill can be absolutely leveled on its own without any investment from this combat-related xp and other skill xp you get in a usual way throughout a playthrough by picking berries.

And finally Quartermastery also support the relation, combat-useful parts (repairing, bolstering, Maintain Uniform) give plenty of xp.

**4.2. Combat skills, issue and solution**

And now we get to four problem skills in the middle, Athletics, Warrapt, Dreadheart and Chivalry.

Athletics is probably the chief example as it has many very combat-useful passives which take up skills levels and focus points to unlock but don't give new skill xp income streams. Contrast with weapon masteries, where each has more active abilities giving mastery xp on use, and where even most of the passives indirectly increase incoming xp by making it easier to deal damage to the enemies.

The same issue is also present in Warrapt, if to a lesser extent, and in Dreadheart and Chivalry, if again to an even lesser extent. And this is felt by the players as a sort of pressure to make up for this discrepancy by shoring these four skills up by preferentially (to a certain extent, varies from player to player) investing in them.

And as already was stated above, proper way to solve this issue is to give some skill xp when the skill's passive is being useful in combat or in combat-adjacent circumstances.

How exactly?

As already discussed in passing on discord, for example if evaded a trap due to Trap Reaction, give Athletics xp. How to determine if due to Trap Reaction? Tabulate all sources of trap avoidance, and use a roll to determine which source it is due.

In the same vein, if you dodge an attack and it was because of bonus from an Athletics passive, give some Athletics xp. Again could determine if due to Athletics by tabulating all dodge sources and rolling to select the source that was the cause.

If you recover energy in combat and a portion of energy was recovered due to Athletics passive, give some xp proportional to energy recovered, e.g. 0.1 xp per 1 energy recovered due to Athletics passive — so that it would give 0.15 Athletics xp per combat turn with all Athletics energy passives.

Are you moving in combat? Give some small amount if xp proportional to raw bonus speed due to Athletics over the base of 100, e.g. 1 xp times (bonus speed due to Athletics) / 100.

Evasive Fury, Dance of Shadows or Shadow Mirage proc? Give some xp, it's direct exercise of the skill.

Obviously it should be shown in a passive's tooltip if it could give xp and how much.

For Warrapt, give some small xp for each attack, maybe proportional to the magnitude of +damage% due to base passive Martial Focus.

Performing any ability with bonus from Efficient Dispatch and/or Accelerated Warfare? Give some small Warrapt xp, maybe proportional to the magnitude of energy cost / time reduction.

Martial Flourish procs? Give some xp. Quick Swap procs? Give xp. An arrow is deflected due to Arrow's Bane? Give xp. Guarded Wait, Prepare for Defense, Prepare for Onslaught, Prepare for War proc? Give xp. Enemy missed due to Predictive Veering or Reactive Maneuver? Give xp.

It's all in essence is direct exercise of the skill in response to circumstances or enemy action, even if it is presented as a passive effect.

Same for Dreadheart and Chivalry, when things proc or work, give xp.

For Dreadheart, could give some xp on Dogged Resolve, Savage Bleed, Savage Swings and Savage Resolve procs, and also if critted due to Primal Fury.

For Chivalry, could give some xp on Heroic Onslaught, Last Stand, Vanguard's Edge, Shield Deflection. Energy is recovered in combat due to Shield Expert? Give some xp.

Naturally, given xp should not be too large so that pace of skill progression becomes unbalanced, just enough to somewhat offset the slower leveling speed issue for these four skills.

**4.3. Passive procs for some support skills**

As an aside, could also extend the same principle to other skills where seems applicable.

For Quartermastery, could give some xp each time player moves when in sight of an enemy, e.g. 0.1 xp times (current inventory weight / max weight), where the ratio can be greater than 1 if overloaded.

For Survival, could give some xp if avoided trap due to Trap Avoidance, spotted trap due to Trap Sense, and when recovered energy in combat due to Deep Breathing and Survivor's Resilience, e.g. as with Athletics like 0.1 xp per 1 energy recovered due to Survival's passives.

For Enchanting, could give additional xp on Crystal Trickery, Crystal Conservation and Arcane Reclamation procs, justified as direct application of the skill required to be more efficient.

**5. Conclusion**

So overall, I would suggest:

1. Allowing investing skill points into weapon masteries to give players the agency they currently lack there.
    
    (Would also suggest full skill unification, so that weapon masteries are only discovered on weapon equip and would need to be unlocked with skill points from level up just as other skills — both for I. realism, as it bugs me when a character have just taken up a weapon and suddenly is already proficient to the point of being able to spend a focus point, and for II. unification, it just feels so right when weapon masteries and general skills work the same fundamentally.)
    
2. For combat skills, add giving out some additional xp on procs of passives to fix reported skill leveling speed issues and to relieve some of tension between masteries, combat skills and support skills.
