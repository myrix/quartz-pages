# Notes

[Voronoi tesselation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) for determining which dungeons are suitable for generic 'defeat a dungeon' quests? Like which fit definition of 'nearby'.

Voronoi tesselation algorithm: [Fortune's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune's_algorithm).

There are repeated requests for information from players on the matter of closing shops.

On Discord, non-exhaustive selection:

> \@myrix though maybe there was one but closed due to falling prosperity

On Steam:

Lycan — [Disappearing Shopkeepers](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1519490/discussions/0/4630358783061740872/)

Judio — [Why Is Everything Suddenly Locked Up?](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1519490/discussions/0/4295943916777878209/)

So it would be better if the game could inform players on this more reliably, and I could suggest two ways:

**1. Diegetic, via in-game dialog and quests**

If the town has a closed shop, could have dialog options on the governor, the guard captain and the innkeeper, maybe slightly different ones, something with the gist of: "Destitute establishments?" — "Yeah, raids, danger, people are fleeing. Would be better if we could clear out nearby gremlin and bandit bases, but we just don't have the strength."

Could also have a random response on civilians, guards and adventurers, something to the gist of:

"Seen another shop closed today? \<name\> said it's not worth it with all the raids and left."

"Wish the guards could nip the raids at the bud, but they only have the strength to patrol nearby, not conduct expeditions."

And we can tie into that another kind of generic quest, given by guard captains or guards in smaller towns, to defeat a nearby bandit/gremlin dungeon, if there is one undefeated nearby — similar to the unique one starting the gremlin quest line, but generic and for any gremlin/bandit dungeon.

There would be a possibility of players taking such quests, doing them, and seeing directly how prosperity rises and new shops appear.

**2. Pop-up tutorial, short and concise**

First time when the player goes back to a town that now have a shop closed which was seen by the player as open before, could present following pop-up tutorial:

"\<shop_type\> is now closed. Shop owners leave and shops close due to falling prosperity of the town.

Town prosperity could be propped up by defeating nearby dungeons to prevent raids, by helping to defend towns against the raids and by doing quests in towns."

It's short and to the point, and can be justified in taking the player's time and attention due to prosperity being core mechanic and shop availability being an important matter.
