Can't use mouse for moving into entities — [[Tutorial on moving through NPCs, summons]], for performing ambiguous actions — [[Option for disambiguating mouse selection]].

Would be better if could have to do everything with the mouse.

Disambiguation menu?

Left click always default action which might change on context (move into tile, attack enemy, move into and swap places with a friendly), an option (if ambiguous if pick up loot or interact, depending on the option pop up disambiguation menu).

Right click always brings disambiguation menu? So that means when right-clicking on entity have both entity info and the d-menu?

ctrl-click can't gather resourses, open doors
