# Notes

After discussion on the 1st proposal, [[Confusion on entering wilderness]], see the \#general channel of the Discord:

> or like you said, if some time has passed, or finished a quest, or visited a dungeon, whatever comes first, and never entered wilderness yet ---
> 
> show this tutorial pop-up (with info about keyboard key also for keyboard-only) and start glowing explore button, goes away on Esc or mouse over explore button or keypress E to enter
> I would still advocate for shadeover and everything else disabled, it would not be a beginning and there would be a reason for it, but can do without it

The final suggestion I think would be best:

In the overworld, after leaving a town for the first time and coming onto a wilderness tile, show a tutorial pop-up, highlight the 'Explore' button, activate its tooltip and shade the rest of the UI.

In the pop-up, inform the player about ability to explore wilderness, e.g. like this:

"Wilderness tiles can be explored by clicking the 'Explore' button or by using the \[E\] key.

Wilderness can be a source of resources and experience, but it can also be a source of danger depending on it's type and surroundings."

The pop-up, highlighting and the tooltip would go away on closing the pop-up, which can be done as usual via mouse click on a close pop-up icon or via keyboard Esc.

It's a core mechanic, so it warrants a small interruption, one slightly more than the first overworld tutorial on Wilderness Danger.

> - Issue is that I felt like that the game kept informing me that it is first-and-foremost a roguelike, and it took me while till I realized that I can explore wilderness tiles to gather some resources and I don't have to be super thrifty about everything I do. I wish it were clearer about that.
