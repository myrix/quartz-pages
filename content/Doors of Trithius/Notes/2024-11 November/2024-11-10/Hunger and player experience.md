Player's [impression on hunger](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1519490/discussions/0/4630357311925345101/) among other things, also to a certain extent related to travel weariness:

> Hunger sucks. It's a random curse that hits, then you have to notice and push a button. Not fun. Unmanageable random punishments are not fun.

Can do QoL of automatically consuming? Like designate food items for automatic consumption.

Can add more tactical and strategic depth and more positive reward?
