# Back up your saves suggestion

Better to add customary "back up your saves" suggestion, unless definitely doesn't need to:

# Test save conversion both from in-tile and overworld

For the same reason, if an update involves save conversion, should test it both from an in-tile save and an overworld save.

# Previous version as beta

Ensure that the previous version is available as a beta.

In patch notes, add a mention, something like: "If you'd like to continue playing \<version\>, you can select it in betas."
