Discover all skills (weapon masteries, general skilsl, magic skills) that were unlocked in the previous game, upon which new game + is started.

For each xp category (each skill, wisdom) give an xp bonus factor, which is `max(1, level from previous game - current level)`, so if e.g. had reached 20 athletics in the previous game, would have x19 Athletics xp factor when it's level 1, x18 when it's 2 and so on, and x1 Athletics xp when it's level 19 or greater.

And the same for wisdom, if e.g. reached level 47 in the previous game, would have x46 wisdom xp factor when is character level 1, x45 wisdom xp when is character level 2, and so on.

TODO: More concrete values? Effective xp vs. raw xp, effective level?

Would work good with all skills needed to be discovered first, including weapon masteries, and magic generalist penalty.
