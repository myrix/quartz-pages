If leave a fully incarnated Dark Shadow in a location, with time it would be converted to Dark Shadow faction which would send out armies and try to get more territory.

Could get an emergent story of an shadow invation apocalypse caused by the player now having to deal with consequences of their own actions. Could they do it, overcome the threat and clean up the mess they caused?

Maybe after dark shadow fully incarnates and starts attacking indiscriminately, have filling a 2nd meter equal to the player's original max hp, and when fully healed the shadow stops just attacking everything and starts behaving more intelligently, attacking weaker enemies and running from more dangerous.

Mobs perhaps including copies of the original dark shadow incarnated in the image of the player at that moment.
