See *merusalem*'s experience in [Steam discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1519490/discussions/0/6400272499512255962/) on how it's hard to medicine treat bonded summons and summons in general.

More evidence for additional summons/bonded summons regimes, as outlined in my Nature Magic suggestion?
