> I remember thinking the orb was like a new game + button. So I spent a bunch of time finishing what I wanted, getting my equipment together, thinking I only got to bring what was on the character, then used the orb, only to find out "I won" instead of the game starting over.

> Hello, @Sineso I have suggestion, maybe the ascended character can be save to `template` that only contain the equipment used during the `artifact activation` and when the next update that not compatible with old save, the player still can use this `template` to start new game and experience new content more fast, or maybe give `ascended point` that can be use for leveling up `legendary trait` so replaying over new update can be more rewarding.
