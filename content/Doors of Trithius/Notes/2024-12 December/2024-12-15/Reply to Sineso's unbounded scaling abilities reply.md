A follow-up in the discussion on bounded scaling abilities started by [my suggestion](https://myrix.github.io/quartz-pages/Doors-of-Trithius/Suggestions/2024-10-October/2024-10-29/October-suggestions/Text---Unbounded-scaling-abilities/Text) and continued with @Sineso's [reply](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gAaIx1MHiLt7sy5skea1lcvBaEm-z-W-PcAelRbCot4/edit) and partially later on Discord.

# Gaming fun

I'd like to start with elaboration on the understanding of gaming fun and how it may be possible to bridge our view points.

As far as I understood you in our conversation, you're aiming the game for the kind of fun given by mental, emotional catharsis, when you have a lead-up to a situation, a sufficiently gripping struggle, a moment of a breakthrough, achievement, and then an intense feeling of, as you could variously call it, truly earned accomplishment, higher level gratification, being high on life.

In contrast to that, when I talk about satisfaction in my suggestion, it's something with a steady rate, spread out in time, more or less continuous or what is felt as if it's continuous, something not as intense or deep, just perhaps more of the same pleasant thing, without this sharp moment of manifestation of a feeling.

The unified understanding is rather obvious, conceptually we can file it all in the same category, gratification, just of varying intensity, deepness, meaningfullness, and of varying steadiness, burstiness.

Of course it can't be denied that for the purposes of giving players the best gaming experience cathartic gratification is better than the gratification from steadily accumulating growth, but they are not exclusive, rather they are sort of parallel lanes we should both use to give the players to best gaming experience, or rather even I would say they are together on a more or less continuous spectrum of intensity and burstiness, and even that there's some interplay when the player's perception of and the kind of gratification the same situations provide shift with time.

For example, you as a completely new player kill your first enemy, get xp and loot, that's closer to cathartic end of the gratification spectrum, then as you kill more and more standard enemies the gratification from such kills slowly shifts into a steady satisfaction source, only the boss kill now being cathartic, then they also shift more and more to steady satisfaction, until only the final boss is left to provide cathartic experience.

An in-game example: starting enemies, then simple gremlins, then more unusual types of gremlins, including gremlin chiefs, then gremlin generals, then the gremlin king, and then it's the transition to steady satisfaction, with each clearing of another yet undefeated gremlin dungeon still feeling good but being more and more of the same.

Another in-game example: skeletons and zombies in crypts, then liches, then crypt bosses, and again after that it's more and more of steady satisfaction.

Or even generic quest, first time you do a generic quest and get the wisdom and the reward, it's victory, while each additional one is more and more just, while good and satisfactory, more of the same.

Or character levels, first time you level up it's on intense burst of 'yeah!!!', it continues for some levels as each level gets you a new skill or another skill points for a skill level for a focus point for that shiny new ability, but after a while it's again gradually transitions to more of the same good, still good, but not as intense.

## Need for steady satisfaction sources

Would like to note here how these examples immediately illustrate two reasons why we would like to have conditions for steady satisfaction sources in the game.

First, it's what you get gratification from after a) all unique cathartic resources are exhausted and after b) new experiences that were cathartic with time and repetition transition to a more of the same good feeling, exactly the steady satisfcation mode. 

Can label this the afterglow reason.

Second, it's what forms the background for other gratification sources. Different steady satisfaction sources are introduced into the gameplay at different rates, both on their own and due to different rates of transition of cathartic things and steady things, and at any given moment there are, and should be, several such sources available. That's good, and we even want as much as possible of these, because such background:

1. Highlights and makes more pleasurable more foreground, more bursty, more cathartic achievements due to the halo effect.
    
    E.g. you defeat your first gremlin general with all the associated rewards, but meanwhile you get more and more of loot and character xp and skill xp from defeating everything else in the preceeding floors, and that makes everything even better.

2. Bouys the player experience when there are negative feelings due to frustration and struggle with the challenge, which is required for the best kind of cathartic gratification.
    
    E.g. the player is not yet good enough, fails to defeat gremlin king encounter, feels down, but can take solace in the loot and xp they got while plundering the king's fortress, and can go instead to e.g. do more generic quests and defeat lesser gremlin dungeons to both restore frustration/gratification balance and get stronger in the meantime so that they're closer to taking on the king.

Can label this the halo reason.

For both reasons it's better to ensure that existing steady satisfaction sources don't break down along the gameplay progression and, whenever and wherever it's possible without negative repercussions, introduce to the game additional avenues of steady satisfaction.

And this has immediate application concerning our original topic, abilities with unbounded scaling and stat scaling transforms.

Our cathartic/steady gratification spectrum works with skill levelling in a usual way, getting first skill level up is cathartic; next levels are less so, but still there are distinct burst of getting new useful abilities, especially if an ability-based build comes online, and at least the initial scaling ability gives a background of steady satisfaction for each new skill level; and then it gradually transitions in a usual way to a more of a steady satisfaction state, each additional skill level being more of a usual good.

Except! This steady satisfaction avenue actually breaks when we unlock everything in the skill, with parcels of satisfaction from each additional skill level now being poisoned by frustration from uselessness of focus points you can't spend.

That's not good, it would be better for this satisfaction avenue to not break, and for that we need unbounded scaling abilities that use or scale off focus points.

And, as, all other things being equal, it's better to have as many of satisfaction avenues as possible, we need many unbounded scaling abilities, a fitting set for each skill, and we need to introduce stat scaling â€” the latter not just due to unbounded scaling abilities, but also due to intrinsic nature of some stats that should not scale linearly at sufficiently high levels.

And as it's better to have a variety of unbounded scaling abilities, we need to be able to have an unbounded scaling effect for any stat, and for that reason we need to took into appropriate scaling transform for each stat.

Yeah, there's a question of mushiness as a possible undesirable consequence of stat scaling, but I believe that's not much of a problem, or at least that there's a possible solution for that, as I will expand on later.

## Intrinsic importance of steady satisfaction avenues

Steady satisfaction is important not just because it compliments cathartic gratification, but because, depending on the player, it can be actually more important, or at least have more importance that usual.

I believe can present at least two distinct possibilities that may produce such an effect, both based on my own game playing experience, but of course there may be more.

The 1st possibility.

The first possibility is the positive effect on importance of steady satisfaction due to relative prevalence of collecting, accumulating, could even say hoarding tendencies in the makeup of an individual player's intentions and psychology.

Accumulating, collecting and hoarding being discussed here aren't restricted to game items, you can actually hoard whatever, everything, char levels, skill levels, ability levels, stat value levels, explored tiles and tile exploration fraction, defeated dungeons, defeated enemies, completed quests, fully prosperous settlements, and of course, various loot.

A little aside, for some of these quantities, e.g. number of explored tiles, tile exploration percentage, defeated enemies, completed quests, the game doesn't actually have a way to track the quantity in question, and that's not good, that's another obvious steady satisfaction avenue that's missing, and it would be better to add they ways to track the quantities into the game.

Disproportionate predisposition to accumulating, collecting and hoarding a) elevates quality of gratification you get from more of the same, bringing it closer to the cathartic end of the spectrum, and b) slows down the rate of depreciation you get from each additional collectible, so that the overall gratification from steady satisfaction avenues is increased.

For players with such predisposition anything that increases satisfaction from steady satisfaction sources actually disproportionally, greatly increase their gratification from the game; and if the predisposition is actually present to a sufficient degree, overall gratification from the general progression with all its associated steady satisfaction sources can be as great or even greater than the overall gratification from all the cathartic sources. So for such players steady satisfaction sources have an added degree of intrinsic importance.

Extremely collectory players might like nothing more than more and more content to collect various types of distilled tokens of gameplay experiences from and use as more and more varied never-ending sources of steady satisfaction.

Moreover, as player kinds are on a continuous spectrum, almost nobody is purely some singular thing, the same effect actually applies to all players, just in proportion to the extent they have aforementioned accumulating, collecting and hoarding tendencies.

The 2nd possibility.

The second possibility is the negative effect on importance of cathartic gratification due to relative prevalence of tendencies of aversion to challenge, risk, struggle and accompanying frustration in the makeup of an individual player's intentions and psychology.

Players with such tendencies players can disproportionally avoid much of the cathartic gratification that requires challenge, risk, struggle and can result in frustration and instead modify their gameplay habits such that they get disproportionally more gratification from steady satisfaction sources, both a) due to direct gratification-seeking behaviour for sources not tainted by frustration and b) due to the fact that front-loading of progression to increase their capabilities and reduce frustration from undesirable aspects of cathartic gratification indirectly leads to increase of gratification from steady satisfaction sources.

E.g. if you are averse to struggle and risk and accompanying frustration of harder quests and boss fights, you might focus more on exploration and clearing of easier non-quest locations and generic quests just for their intrinsic rewards; and if you're expecting a harder quest or a boss fight in the future, you might specifically grind more or adopt a grindier playstyle for a time, short or long, to increase your capabilities before the expected struggle.

And both behaviours result in increase of the fraction of gratification you get from steady satisfaction sources as opposed to cathartic sources, adding a degree of intrinsic importance to the former.

Extremely risk-frustration-averse players might front-load progression to the point of almost total elimination of the challenge and therefore, ultimately, significant part cathartic gratification, getting majority of gratification from steady satisfaction sources â€” essentially, so to speak, turning the game into a cozy game.

And again, just like with the 1st possibility, player predispositions are on the spectrum, so the same reasoning applies to all players, just in proportion to the extent they are challenge-averse, risk-averse, struggle-averse and frustration-averse.

Need to note in conclusion that these two possibilities are not a failure of the game but the opposite, a success, an achievement. You definitionally can't ultimately force a player to play in a way they don't like, but you can provide the player a variety of tools they can pick and choose from to assemble and tweak a gameplay they would get the most, highest gratification from.

That's a strength of the game, to be able to cater to various needs, various playstyles, various types players.

# Crispiness vs. mushiness

Going off your following comment:

> Math balance aside, even with a perfect curve, I think making ALL stats scale, has some negative effects (turning the game mushy).

Please correct me if I'm to any extent wrong in my understanding, but as far as I see, it refers to the possible negative influence of more gradual stat change on the ability of the game to provide cathartic gratification.

As said above, getting a cathartic experience requires a sufficiently crisp and defined gripping struggle so that it's possible to have a moment of breakthrough; and to design such sufficiently crisp and defined struggle, gameplay elements comprising both player capabilities and things players struggle against need to be sufficiently crisp and defined.

Mass stat scaling can work against it due to introducing more and more granularity into the scale player's capabilities, making it loose this crispness and definition and ultimately making it harder to design gameplay content capable of providing cathartic gratification.

So we have a conundrum, two opposite concerns:

1. Better to have many many scaling abilities as steady satisfaction avenues, and that might necessitate scaling for all or almost all or significant portion of the stats.

2. Scaling for all or almost all or significant portion of the stats can make it harder to design the game to and for the game to provide cathartic gratification.

We can solve this by using the situational separation and then making the best we can of the situation.

First, cathartic gratification relies on unique or almost unique content, and in an average over playthroughs there's a point, of where either the playthrough ends or all of the unique content is exhausted.

Second, proposed stat scaling transforms are all piece-wise linear and 1-to-1 near the origin, so any stat with such a transform would behave as if it is not scaled up to a certain stat value; that means that up to a certain progression extent there's no stat scaling mushiness at all, and that after mushiness rises gradually as more and more stats transition into actual scaling.

Moreover, one of the types of stat sources likely to push a stat into an actual scaling region, unbounded scaling abilities, are expected to become available to the player only in the mid and end portions of playthrough, so that's another delay on the point where stat mushiness becomes significant.

That means that by tweaking stat sources and their availability, including unbounded scaling abilities, we can ensure that overall, on average overlap between the portion of the playthough where the player experiences most or all of the cathartic content â€” say, up to a level 50 or whatever â€” and the portion of the playthrough with significant mushiness is small enough.

And obviously we can tweak and disable/enable stat scaling for any stat until we'd get to the overall optimal configuration.

# Additional skill ability UI

Just to reiterate for the possiblity of expanded skill pane UI, able to provide the tree and the stars metaphor, in all playthroughs skill pane UI would start as it's now, and would only expand gradually skill by skill for any skill that would acquire any additional abilities you can acquire mid-playthrough.

There's a possibility to actually have both a separate trainer and/or workstation additional skill UI and a conditionally expanded the tree and the stars skill pane UI.

What could be a reason for this?

1. To have more content in the game, additional, secret, discoverable things in the game.
    
    More varied content is better in general, means more ways to satisfy players.

3. To use these separate UIs for separate types of abilities.
    
    Separate by e.g. ability nature â€” related to only a single skill vs. requiring multi-skill prerequisites or being in a completely new skill, or by a way the ability is acquired, actively at a trainer or workstation vs. passively discovered during skill leveling after fulfilling necessary hidden conditions.

# Active vs. passive discovery mechanics

This, discovered actively vs. discovered passively, actually ties in to a possible [[Text#Possible implementation of discovery mechanic|discovery mechanic]] in the original proposal, which works passively with skill leveling as opposed to a possible discovery mechanic I heard of from you, which would involve spending resources at workstation.

Again, there's a possibility to actually implement both discovery mechanisms in the game, and again, the reason to do so would be to add to the game more beneficial variety.

There are actually such soft of active vs. passive alternatives in the game already, different ways to achieve the same goal actively, more quickly, or passively, just along the normal gameplay:

1. Can seek out gold actively from quest and dungeon plunder vs. can just accumulate it passively along the normal gameplay.

2. Can level quartermastery actively by hunting human enemies and buying mats from merchants or by investing skill points from character levels vs. can just level it passively, if slowly, from repairing equipment along the normal gameplay.

3. Can actively seek required quantities of specific foods and food ingredients vs. can just use whatever food you get along the normal gameplay.

4. Can actively aim to discover and unlock specific skills and acquire specific abilities in a targeted fashion to get a specific build as fast as possible vs. can just get and use whatever skills and abilities are available in the moment.

So can also have an active way to discover recipes and/or abilities, and a passive way.

Again, various ways make the game more able to cater to various needs, various playstyles, various player types and to leave players satisfied with higher probability.
