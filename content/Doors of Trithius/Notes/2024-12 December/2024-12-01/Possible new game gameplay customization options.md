    > When you purchase houses in towns, is there a way to make the chests in your houses 'shared', so that you can deposit items in one house, and retrieve them in a different house?
    > If not, I'd like to suggest this functionality, whether it be an optional game setting, a purchasable upgrade for each house, or require some other way to obtain.
