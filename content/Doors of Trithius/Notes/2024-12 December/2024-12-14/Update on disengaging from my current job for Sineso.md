**Update on disengaging from my current job**

Discussed with my team lead, came to preliminary understanding, unless something unexpected happens I would be able to work for you starting January; with two footnotes. Preliminary cause there's need to confirm with the director of the institute where I work, but I don't foresee any issues with that.

1st footnote is that the agreement with my team is that I would still work with them part-time, up to 8 hours per week on average; that is both what I've already done before, around several years ago, and what I believe would be most fitting for me in present situation given that

a) mainly, as you specified in the 'Working At Trithius Games' doc you sent me there's no 100% certainty working for you would be a long-term position, so if not, I'll be able to seamlessly return back to my current job no problem, and

b) secondary, I actually like the project I worked on all these years, already 8 years as of now actually, and even if I'm to some degree is quite mentally tired and bored of it already, I would be glad to still support it to some extent, and consult the team when required.

I'm positive that I would be able to give you, on average, 40 hours of work per week while still giving my current project its part-time 8 hours, and that what I'll be aiming for; but even if not, I'm absolutely sure that I would be able to give you your required 30 hours on average per week.

Flexibility in work hour structure is actually very fitting here and is not new to me, all these years I worked exactly like that, from home with flexible schedule for a set amount of work time, so I would be able to seamlessly transition to working with you.

2nd footnote is a piece of info that came up in my discussion with my team lead as a surprise to me, wish I would have known it sooner. I don't foresee it being a problem, but I'm absolutely sure you definitely need to know and make sure there's full understanding and certainty on your end.

Apparently since the end of October the institute where I work, Institute for System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences, is under sanctions from USA Treasury as a technology company whose software products, in the opinion of U.S. Department of the Treasury, indirectly enable Russia's war efforts, you can check [Treasury's press release](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2700), search for "Institute for System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences".

I don't see it precluding me working for you as an independent contractor, as I am an employee, not the organization, not even in any kind of executive or management role, I never worked on any of the things the Treasury apparently considers helpful to war efforts, all I ever worked on for last 8 years is the support for pure linguistics research, the Lingvodoc https://lingvodoc.ispras.ru/ project.

But of course you absolutely have to make sure for yourself on your end with 100% certainty.

Other than that, there's nothing to bring up before our scheduled discussion call I guess, I fully agree with everything in the 'Working At Trithius Games' doc.
