# General tips

Don't spread to wide, do one thing at a time

actually exactly one thing at a time

Farming mats:

kill around castles, disassemble in castles  

For castles:

need camp nearby
bandits don't attack settlements, only guard armies
so castles not a priority, though are important for prosperity
